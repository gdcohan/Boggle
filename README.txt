README:

This program allows a user to play the game Boggle against a computer opponent. The user finds as many words as he can in the puzzle before the computer finds all the remaining words. 

This program was created as part of an assignment for Stanford's CS106B class. As such, it uses support code from the class including the gboggle.h file, which provides graphics support, and a number of container classes such as Set, Grid, and Vector.
